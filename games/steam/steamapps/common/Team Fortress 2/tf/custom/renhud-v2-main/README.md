# RenHud V2

RenHUD Recreated, Reimagined, Reworked

Fixed version of my previous hud, RenHUD which is discontinued because I lost interest in the game
I remade the entire thing instead of uploading V1 to huds.tf because V1 was just so insanely buggy, ugly and had a lot of
missing features and other stuff that I just had to remake it. It looks way better now, (almost) everything is changed to match the style,
and most issues have been fixed. It's possible that there are issues with it still, and if there are, I suggest you hop on over to
my discord server, and report them in the hud channel [#renhud-v2](https://discord.gg/cWRRs47WYc)
